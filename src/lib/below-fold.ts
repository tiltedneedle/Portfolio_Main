/**
 * Below the fold, once: the rule behind every block that is served at rest
 * and comes on as the reader reaches it (Reveal, Odometer, TypeOn). A
 * block still below the fold when the page settles is held
 * back, and let go once it is a margin into view; a block already on
 * screen, or above it, is left alone.
 *
 * Each block used to decide with a getBoundingClientRect in its own mount
 * effect, then write a class. On a guide page that is forty-odd reads, each
 * forcing the layout the block before it had just invalidated: on a
 * throttled phone, 780ms of the load went on it. Here IntersectionObservers
 * do all the measuring. Their entries arrive in one batch after the
 * browser's own layout, with the block's box and the screen's already
 * taken, so nothing here reads the layout at all -- not even
 * window.innerHeight, which on a phone is itself a forced layout. First
 * sight is taken with no margin, so the entry's root is the screen itself;
 * the block is then handed to an observer with the release margin. The
 * observers are shared: one for first sight, one per release margin.
