# Tilted Needle — The Editing Room

Next.js 16 (App Router, Turbopack) · React 19 · Tailwind v4 · Framer Motion

The studio's site, built as the room where a reel is assembled. One dark
visual world; the home page runs as a reel; the six films stand 9:16 on a
timeline the scroll shuttles; route changes are cuts. The treatment that led
here is in `PROGRESS.md`, which is also the resume point for anyone picking
the work up.

## Running

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

```bash
npm run build
npx next start -p 3400
```

If `next start` fails with `EADDRINUSE`, an older instance still holds the
port and you would be verifying a stale build. Kill it first:

```powershell
Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 3400 -State Listen | ForEach-Object { Stop-Process -Id $_.OwningProcess -Force }
```

## Routes

| Route | Notes |
|---|---|
| `/` | The reel: slate (once per device), cold open, sequence, title card, credits, results, end slate |
| `/film/[slug]` | One film per page: the published cut (YouTube, loaded on Play) or a link to it, transport for self-hosted files, a match cut to the next, its own share card |
| `/services` | The studio: four capabilities as an index |
| `/services/[slug]` | Four detail pages, statically generated from `src/lib/services-data.ts` |
| `/portfolio` | The library: a pannable, zoomable contact sheet of every published vertical clip |
| `/careers` | Crew call: perks, expandable roles, application form |
| `/book-demo` | Calendly embed, coloured from the URL so it sits in the room |
| `/privacy`, `/terms` | Shared `LegalPage` component |
| `/api/contact` | Form handler (see below) |

`src/app/(site)/` is a route group and does not appear in URLs. `/portfolio`
sits outside it because it owns the full viewport and renders no footer.

## The system

`src/app/globals.css` holds everything. Four rules carry the look:

1. Display type is the condensed face (Big Shoulders Display), heavy,
   uppercase, tight leading. One word of a statement drops to the serif
   italic (Instrument Serif), lowercase: `Cut for the <em>scroll.</em>`
2. The only interface colour is the tally lamp, `--tally`, and it means
   **state** (playing, live, in flight, error). It never sits on a button.
3. Labels are mono (JetBrains Mono), 11px, uppercase, tracked: `.mono`.
   Numbers are tabular. Timecodes use `.tc`.
4. Corners are square (2px) or pill. Nothing between.

Tokens: `--stage` / `--stage-2` / `--stage-3` for the ground, `--ink` /
`--ink-soft` / `--ink-mid` for text, `--ink-faint` for decoration only (it
fails contrast below 24px), `--rule` / `--rule-strong` for hairlines. The
old paper-system names (`--paper`, `--slab`, …) are aliased so nothing
reads an undefined variable.

Fonts are vendored in `src/app/fonts/` (all SIL OFL). The site uses the
variable woff2 files; the `.woff` copies exist only for the OpenGraph image,
because Satori cannot read woff2 or variable fonts. Swapping a licensed face
in is a one-file change in `src/app/layout.tsx`.

## The room's parts (`src/components/room/`)

- **Slate** — the clapperboard intro. Server-rendered so nothing flashes
  beneath it; a layout effect removes it before first paint for anyone who
  has seen it (`localStorage` `tn-slate-seen`) or prefers reduced motion.
- **ColdOpen** — the statement over a drifting strip of published stills
  (HeroBackdrop), with the room's readouts (running timecode, studio
  clocks) and two mono controls.
- **Sequence** — six 9:16 frames on a pinned strip. Vertical scroll drives
  the horizontal shuttle; the ruler underneath shows the playhead and a
  timecode. The frame under the playhead plays, hover plays any other,
  focus drives the scroll so keyboard users see what they land on. On
  phones the frames stack full-screen and play as they arrive. Every frame
  has a slate that stands until the video reports a frame; a failed source
  reads **Offline** and stops asking for a load slot.
- **TitleCard, CreditsRoll, ResultsSlate, EndSlate** — the studio, the
  clients, the results, contact.
- **FilmPage** — the film in its well with transport; the idea; the numbers.
- **CutLink / CutOverlay** (`src/lib/cut.ts`) — route changes drop a black
  frame, hold it 140ms after the new route commits, then lift. A safety
  timer lifts it after 2.5s regardless. Links prefetch on hover so the frame
  waits on the router, not the network. Reduced motion skips the cut.
- **Cursor** — on fine pointers the arrow becomes a ring that names the
  click (`data-cursor="Play|Open|Cut|Scrub|Pause"`). Touch and reduced
  motion keep the native cursor; so do iframes.
- **Readouts, TopMark** — small instruments.

## Data

- `src/lib/films.ts` — the six films, slugged and numbered, joined with
  `posters.json` (poster path + duration when extracted).
- `src/lib/case-studies-data.ts` — the case studies the films are built on.
- `src/lib/services-data.ts`, `site-data.ts`, `board-videos.ts`, `legal-data.ts`.

### The published index (where the pictures come from)

The original video files were lost with the previous hosting account (see
`RECOVERY.md`). The site's pictures now come from the studio's own index of
published work, exported read-only from the ops database:

```bash
node scripts/published.mjs
```

That writes `src/lib/published.json` (every published clip with a durable
still: YouTube's own 9:16 thumbnail for Shorts, the studio's cached copy for
the rest) and `src/lib/published-picks.json` (the per-film picks, the reel,
and the library count, so the home page never carries the full index). The
library renders the index as a contact sheet and plays YouTube clips in its
lightbox; Instagram and TikTok posts open as a still with a link. Films whose
client has a Short embed it on the film page; films whose client is not in
the index show their slate.

### Posters (self-hosted route)

`node scripts/posters.mjs` pulls one frame per film with ffmpeg and writes
`public/posters/<slug>.jpg` plus `src/lib/posters.json`, which win over the
index picks when present. Run it once the original files are re-hosted and
the URLs in the data files point somewhere live.

## Contact form

`POST /api/contact` sends via Resend when both env vars are set:

```
RESEND_API_KEY=...
CONTACT_FROM=noreply@yourdomain.com
CONTACT_TO=info@tiltedneedle.com   # optional, this is the default
```

With no transport configured the route answers `{ fallback: true, to, subject }`
and the client opens a prefilled `mailto:` link, and says "Almost there"
rather than claiming delivery. Per-IP rate limit (5/min, in memory), 16 KB
body cap, per-field caps, type checks, email validation, 8s upstream timeout.
A post whose `Origin` is another site is refused (403), and both forms carry
a hidden honeypot field (`src/lib/honeypot.ts`): a submission with it filled
is answered `{ ok: true }` and dropped.

These variables belong to the Vercel project, and the site moved to its own
project (Portfolio_Main) on 2026-10-09: a new project starts with none, and
until they are set every enquiry takes the `mailto:` route. Never test the
form by sending; run a local server with them unset instead.

## Site address and share cards

`src/lib/site.ts` resolves the address every absolute URL is built on
(canonical links, share cards, robots.txt, the sitemap, structured data):
`NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`, else Vercel's production domain, else
tiltedneedle.com. Adding tiltedneedle.com to the Vercel project moves it
everywhere at once. Pages build their metadata with `pageMeta()`
(`src/lib/page-meta.ts`), because a page that sets `openGraph` replaces the
root's card instead of merging into it. Each film has its own card
(`app/(site)/film/[slug]/opengraph-image.tsx`, shared parts in `src/lib/og.tsx`).

## Images and video

Remote stills go through `next/image`, sized to where they are drawn.
`images.remotePatterns` in `next.config.ts` admits only the exact URL shapes
the data uses (no stray paths or query strings), and `minimumCacheTTL` is a
month: every distinct image, width and format counts against Vercel's
monthly transformation allowance (5,000 on Hobby, then new images fail with
402 until the cycle ends). Background loops use `room/AmbientVideo`, which
loads a small rendition only when its section is near, and nothing at all
for reduced motion, data saver, or (where a section says so) phones.

## Verifying

Visual checks run through Playwright: `next start` on 3400, then drive the
page and screenshot into a scratch directory (never the repo). Inject
`.grain{animation:none}` and force `[style*="opacity"]` to 1 to freeze
reveals for a still. Check `document.body.classList.contains("is-cutting")`
around a click to time the cut. The custom cursor and slate are absent under
`emulateMedia({ reducedMotion: "reduce" })` by design.

## Motion and reduced motion

The `prefers-reduced-motion` block in `globals.css` stops CSS animations
only. Framer Motion ignores it, so every `motion.*` element guards itself
with `useReducedMotion()`: reveals set `initial={false}` or a zero offset,
and nothing is ever parked at `opacity: 0` waiting on an observer that a
reduced-motion user will not trigger. Fades are allowed; movement is not.

Anything on a page's first screen enters in CSS instead (`.enter-rise`,
`.enter-fade`, `.enter-mask`, delay via `style={{ animationDelay }}`): a
Framer `initial` is server-rendered as `opacity: 0` and stays there until
the JavaScript has loaded and hydrated, which on a slow phone left the
headline invisible for seconds after the page had painted. The CSS
entrances start with the first paint, and reduced motion drops them.
